# Emmanuel's Project Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio! Below are some of my key projects that showcase my skills in **network infrastructure, cybersecurity, cloud integration, software development, and cryptography**.

---

## **Microsoft Network Infrastructure and Cloud Integration**  
Deployed a **Windows Server 2022 domain controller** for the `emmanuel.ca` domain, automating **Active Directory (AD)** setup and user management using PowerShell scripts. Configured **Group Policies (GPOs)** to enforce security policies, such as password complexity and user permissions. Set up **Network Policy Server (NPS)** to allow secure **VPN access** for IT Admins and Helpdesk users only. Integrated on-prem AD with **Azure AD (Entra ID)** to enable **Single Sign-On (SSO)** and **hybrid identity management**. Ensured secure access to cloud resources while maintaining security controls on-premises.

**Technologies Used:** Windows Server 2022, Active Directory (AD DS), Group Policy (GPO), Network Policy Server (NPS), PowerShell, Azure AD Connect, VPN

## **Phishing Detector for Email and URL**  
Developed a **web application and browser extension** using **Python** and **JavaScript** to detect phishing attempts by analyzing **email headers** and **URLs**. Employed **machine learning algorithms** (Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression) to classify threats with an accuracy rate of **85%**, thereby enhancing end-user security. Implemented a URL scanning feature to parse links for phishing indicators such as domain age, URL length, and keyword presence. This project is designed to improve email security and detect potential threats in real-time.

**Technologies Used:** Python, JavaScript, Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn), HTML, CSS, Flask, Selenium, Email and URL Parsing

---

## **Penetration Testing on Virtual Networks**  
Conducted a comprehensive **penetration testing exercise** on virtual networks, using tools like **Kali Linux**, **Wireshark**, **Nmap**, and **OpenSSL**. Performed vulnerability assessments, including port scanning, packet analysis, and SSL/TLS certificate validation, to identify security gaps. Delivered a report summarizing findings and recommended mitigation strategies for the identified vulnerabilities, aiming to strengthen network defenses.

**Technologies Used:** Kali Linux, Wireshark, Nmap, OpenSSL, VirtualBox, Vulnerability Assessment Techniques, Network Security

---

## **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) Setup**  
Deployed a **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** using **Snort** and **Wireshark** to monitor network traffic and detect anomalies. Configured custom detection rules within Snort to identify specific types of threats (e.g., brute force, malware signatures) and improve detection accuracy by **25%**. Set up dashboards to visualize network activity, enabling real-time monitoring and incident response capabilities.

**Technologies Used:** Snort, Wireshark, Intrusion Detection Techniques, Network Traffic Analysis, Rule-Based Detection

---

## **SOC Project: Threat Detection and Response System**  
Developed a **Security Operations Center (SOC) threat detection system** using **SIEM tools** and the **MITRE ATT&CK framework** to enhance incident response capabilities. Configured **Windows 10, Windows Server 2022, and Ubuntu** systems to simulate a SOC environment. Integrated **Splunk** and **Sysmon** for centralized log management, enabling efficient monitoring and analysis of security events. This system allowed for the identification of suspicious activity patterns and facilitated an effective incident response workflow.

**Technologies Used:** Splunk, MITRE ATT&CK, Sysmon, SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), Windows Server 2022, Ubuntu, Security Monitoring

---

## **Active Directory Security Audit**  
Performed a comprehensive **security audit on Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS)** to assess and secure configurations. Used **GPO, DHCP, and RAID** to optimize AD infrastructure and reduce risk exposure by **40%**. Configured GPOs to enforce stricter access controls and applied best practices for AD hardening. Assessed and mitigated vulnerabilities in the AD environment to strengthen the security posture of the entire network.

**Technologies Used:** Active Directory (AD DS), Group Policy (GPO), DHCP, RAID, Windows Server 2022, Security Auditing

## **Cryptography Projects**

### **Encrypted Messaging System**  
Developed a **secure messaging application** using **AES encryption** in Python. The application encrypts messages before sending them over the network, ensuring that only the intended recipient can decrypt and read the message.

**Key Features:**  
- End-to-end encryption with **AES-256**.
- User authentication to prevent unauthorized access.
- Simple user interface for easy encryption and decryption of messages.

**Technologies Used:** Python, PyCryptodome  
**GitHub Link:** [Encrypted Messaging System](https://github.com/yourusername/Encrypted-Messaging-System)

### **RSA Key Generator and Digital Signature Validator**  
Built a tool in Python to **generate RSA key pairs** and **digitally sign messages**. This tool includes RSA key generation, message signing, and signature verification.

**Key Features:**  
- **RSA encryption/decryption** for secure data transmission.
- **Digital signature verification** for authentication and integrity.
- Support for various key sizes (2048, 4096).

**Technologies Used:** Python, Cryptography library  
**GitHub Link:** [RSA Key Generator](https://github.com/yourusername/RSA-Key-Generator)

---

### **File Encryption and Decryption Application**  
Created a command-line tool in Python for **file encryption and decryption** using **AES-GCM** mode for enhanced security and data integrity.

**Key Features:**  
- Encrypts files of any format (e.g., text, images, PDFs).
- Uses **AES-GCM** for authenticated encryption, preventing tampering.
- Generates a unique IV (Initialization Vector) for each encryption.

**Technologies Used:** Python, Cryptography library  
**GitHub Link:** [File Encryption Tool](https://github.com/yourusername/File-Encryption-Tool)
